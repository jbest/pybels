Pybels notes

Pybels is my attempt to make it easier to run BELS locally and faster by making a lot of assumptions that were otherwise slow to process.


Preparation
Download DwCA zip files using TORCH_TCN_urls project
Put all ZIP files into one directory
Configure pybels_fast.py to read that directory - zip_dir =???


use pybels_fast.py to read DwCA zips and generate a BELS location file


Use Jupyter Notebook analyze_loc_matches_local.ipynb to analyze
