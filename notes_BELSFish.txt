TORCH BELS / BELSFish analysis notes

First use pybels_fast.py to:
	- generate a single CSV with BELS string from all occurrence records from the DwC data sources in ZIP files
	- or generate a TSV with BELS string from single TSV input

XXX Next use Jupyter Notebook analyze_loc_matches_local.ipynb to analyze and add other BELs info
pybels_fast.py now can add all the additional BELS metrics

Next run BELS_Grouper_simple.py on the output from above
